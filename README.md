My biggest challenge in my data portfolio journey is finding a data set that has enough variety and provides nearly all of the fields necessary to build a standard BI dashboard. After coming across this tweet by Brittany City's suggestion on using ChatGPT to "build your own basic dataset" using the Faker module in Python, I immediately got to work. A software engineer friend (after telling them) was geeked out about a unique use of the module. This method really allowed me to be hands-on with quality checking the data types along with the fields. 

# Project Goals :dart:
- [x] Generate fake data to populate columns for a Sales Performance dataset using Faker Python package
- [x] import the data into Tableau Public desktop
- [x] Create 4-5 charts in Tableau Public highlighting trends of the data
  - including KPIs, any filters
- [ ] update readme file for Github documenting the process and project

# Overview of Project :mag:
Customizing all the fields of a randomized and fake dataset (using the Faker module in Python) with 1,000 sales recoreds and creating a Sales Performance dashboard in Tableau Public.

# Project Steps
